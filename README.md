# VRChat-Shaders

In starting to build a VRChat world, I was looking for a shader to sweep across a material. The goal was a background colour with alpha control (to darken glass) and have a sweep which made the texture visible with a fade-off at the tail of the pulse. A search found nothing and CoPilot started writing me the damn thing when I asked for it to find me an open source shader. And so the idea to just make one was born. The basics for this shader was made by AI, but the functionality, settings how the thing actually works was written by me after trial and error. It may not be perfect, but I have never even looked at shader code before today. I will keep updating this as I fix bugs and add features (possibly audiolink).
